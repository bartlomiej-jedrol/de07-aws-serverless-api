# Project Description

When stepping into Serverless 🌐, finding the right architecture 🏛️ can make all the difference. 


I recently built a Serverless API on AWS 🚀implementing the Services Design Pattern. In the Services Pattern, a single Lambda function can handle a few jobs that are usually related to a single entity of the data model (e.g., User 👤). 

All CRUD operations on the User data model are performed on the single HTTP endpoint using different HTTP methods. 

For this to work, you can have a 'small' router (HTTP method) at the beginning of your Lambda code.⚙️ 

It's different from the Microservices Pattern where each job is isolated within a separate Lambda function.💡 


Benefits of the Services Design Pattern: ✔️

→ Fewer Lambda functions to manage ✔️
→ Reduced cold starts ✔️
→ Team autonomy 👥
→ Faster deployments 🚀


Drawbacks of Services Pattern: ❌
→ More complicated debugging ❌
→ Requires a router ❌
→ Bigger function size ❌
